# Early 20th-Century-Composer-dataset

This dataset consists of the piano works of Early 20th century composers. We divide 10 different composers from the Early 20th century several specific styles: Serialism, Neoclassicism, Impressionism, Nationalism, Late Romantic, and Modern. However, in our study, we only utilize some portions of our dataset (focusing on four different styles only).

For your reference, there are some limitations in our dataset:
1. Only piano works.
2. Focus on first 20 measures (approximately one page).

Regarding the sample sizes, composer name, and styles, the information can be seen below:
