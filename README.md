This dataset consists of the ** piano works** of Early 20th century composers. We divide 10 different composers from the Early 20th century to 4 specific styles: Serialism, Impressionism, Nationalism, and Neoclassicism.

For your reference, there are some limitations in our dataset:
1. Only piano works.
